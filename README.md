### 🛠 Dynamic System Modes
- **Global Mode:** Apply shipping rules across all available shipping methods.
- **Per Method Restriction:** Select a specific shipping method from the dropdown to apply rules exclusively to that method.

### ⚡ Real-time Checkout Validation
- **Live Detection:** Monitors the country selection field on the checkout page instantly.
- **Smart Prevention:** Automatically disables the **"Place Order"** button and displays a high-visibility warning message if a restricted country is selected.

### 📊 Order Metadata & Logging

- **Admin Logs:** View the last 10 restriction activities directly from the plugin dashboard to monitor blocked attempts.
